#First Example

In this Example I try to animate something like this

![Animnation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cantado/AnimationCompare/master/animation1/animation.png "Animation")

The numbers under the pictures are the seconds of the animation.
The duration of the animation is 4 seconds and it repeats.
